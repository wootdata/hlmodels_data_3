Monkey in a suit Deathmatch Model
3D artist: Ninja Monkey

Place the monkey folder in the

\sierra\half-life\valve\models\player folder.

The .mdl file is the model you will see during play.  The .bmp file is
necessary for the model to be selectable via the launcher interface.  For
a player model to be visible to all clients playing, it must be installed on
the server for it to propogate to all playing clients.

When a model is downloaded from the game server, it does not download the
.bmp file necessary for selecting the model in the interface: models must be
deliberately installed by the player.


The colours go slightly dodgy on the custamize screen, but in game it works perfectly.
