Firstly, thnx for downloading my model.
This is the second release of my personal player model for Sven Co-op.
Well, the credits are not really proper, because the sword model was taken from Lt.Chickens
SC pack, and he didnt include the credits for it either... So i'd just like to say thnx to
whoever made this awesome model.XD Shield was taken out from HL1.5:Weapon Edition mod,
and since the developer of that mod didnt include ANY credits, i dont know who made this 
thing. But thnx anyway.=)
I know that its a bit tooo high poly, but im a poly whore, and cant do anything about it. XD
Hope you like it.=)
