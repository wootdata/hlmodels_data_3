Soldier Model
Brought to you by the one and only, 'BrantK/TheBest'
email: BrantK@Hotmail.com

contains: 1 mdl file
	  2 bmp files (sorry about the crappy screenshot)
	  1 txt file (i think you knew that...)
	  

the model was created by simply extracting a file I found in tfc's pak0.pak... It looks 
_AMA2ING_ in game! Set you're colors to the same if you dont want to see the symbol, the
hand. If you like this model, but would prefer, for example, the PYRO, you should now 
know how to do it.
